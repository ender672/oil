= Oil

http://github.com/ender672/oil

== DESCRIPTION:

Oil is a Ruby extension for resizing JPEG and PNG images. It aims for fast
performance and low memory use.

== INSTALLATION:

  $ gem install oil

== SYNOPSIS:

  require 'oil'

  # Simple resize to fit in a 200x300 box
  io_in = File.open('image.jpg', 'rb')
  jpeg = Oil.new(io_in, 200, 300)

  # Write resized image to disk
  io_out = File.open('image_resized.jpg', 'w')
  jpeg.each { |data| io_out << data }

== REQUIREMENTS:

These requirements do not apply to the JRuby gem.

* IJG JPEG Library or libjpeg-turbo.
* libpng

Installing libjpeg headers (OSX):

  $ brew install libjpeg # requires homebrew (http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/)

Installing libjpeg and libpng headers (Debian/Ubuntu):

  $ sudo apt-get install libjpeg-dev libpng-dev

== COMPILING & TESTING:

Compile & run unit tests. Should show no warnings and no failing tests:

  $ rake compile
  $ rake test

Valgrind should not complain (ruby-1.9.3p125, compiled with -O3):

  $ valgrind /path/to/ruby -Iext:test test/test_jpeg.rb
  $ valgrind --suppressions=test/valgrind_suppressions.txt /path/to/ruby -Iext:test test/test_png.rb

Tests should not leak memory:

  $ ruby -Iext:test -e "require 'test_jpeg.rb'; require 'test_png.rb'; loop{ MiniTest::Unit.new.run }"

Changes to the interpolator should be analyzed using ResampleScope:
